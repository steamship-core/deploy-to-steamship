# Deploy to Steamship

This GitHub Action template will deploy your repository's Steamship App or Plugin.

The deployment script contains the following sanity checks:

* That your `steamship.json` project file exists
* That your project has a `type` of either `package` or `plugin`

Along with the following QA checks:

* That your project passes the `pytest` command
* That this Action is being run form a tag called `v###.###.###`
* That project has a version of `###.###.###` (matching the tag, but without the v)

We recommend the following workflow:

* Write tests for yourplugin / app with pytest (preconfigured with all Steamship plugins and apps)
* Release new versions using GitHub's release feature:
  * Tagging the release with standard semver format (e.g. `v1.0.2`)
  * Making sure the `version` field in `steamship.json` matches (e.g. `1.0.2`)
